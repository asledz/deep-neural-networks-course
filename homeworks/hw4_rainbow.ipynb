    "# Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning - from DQN to (almost) Rainbow\n",
    "### Author: Michal Nauman, Editor: Mateusz Olko\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework we will expand upon on the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm [(Mnih 2014)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf). DQN has been successfully applied to a wide range of environments and has demonstrated strong performance on many tasks. However, several challenges and limitations to the DQN that have been identified in the literature:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample complexity - DQN can require a large number of samples to learn effectively, especially in environments with high-dimensional state spaces or a large number of possible actions\n",
    "2. Convergence - DQN is known to converge to the optimal solution under certain conditions, but the convergence properties of the algorithm are not well understood and it is not guaranteed to converge in all cases\n",
    "3. Overestimation - DQN is known to sometimes overestimate the Q-values of certain actions, which can lead to suboptimal behavior\n",
    "4. Sensitivity to hyperparameters - DQN can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, the discount factor, and the exploration scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rainbow algorithm [(Hessel 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298.pdf) is a combination of several techniques for improving the performance of the DQN algorithm, which was originally proposed by DeepMind. By combining several techniques, the Rainbow algorithm is able to improve the sample efficiency, stability and  performance of the DQN algorithm. Overall, the Rainbow algorithm represents an important step forward in the development of reinforcement learning algorithms and is often used as a baseline for implementing more complex changes to the RL setup (e.g. [(Schwarzer 2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05929.pdf) or [(Srinivas 2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04136.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will learn to augment a simple DQN implementation with all the components of Rainbow except for distributional Q-learning. To test our implementations, we will use the Lunar Lander environment. Given resources, the environment is easily solved by a vanilla DQN implementation. But we do not have resources. What we have is a budget of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 40 000 environment steps\n",
    "2. 35 000 Q-network updates \n",
    "\n",
    "And quite inefficient exploration scheme. As such, our basic DQN implementation will not be enough to solve Lunar Landing problem within the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Homework scenario and grading\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide you with a basic implementation of the DQN. Your job is to expand it with the following modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Double Q-Learning - [(van Hasselt 2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf) **1.5 pkt**\n",
    "2. N-step learning - [(Sutton 1988)](http://incompleteideas.net/papers/sutton-88-with-erratum.pdf) **1.5 pkt**\n",
    "3. Noisy linear layers - [(Fortunato et al. 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.10295.pdf) **1.5 pkt**\n",
    "4. Dueling network architecture - [(Wang et al. 2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581.pdf) **1.5 pkt**\n",
    "5. Prioritized experience replay - [(Schaul et al. 2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05952.pdf) **1.5 pkt**\n",
    "6. (Almost) Rainbow - [(Hessel 2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298.pdf) **1.5 pkt**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each module is designed to work independently (i.e. you can implement each individually with DQN). The final task of this homework is to combine all the implemented modules into (almost) Rainbow agent. You get the last point (**1 pkt**) for plotting results for all implemented parts."

    "Deep Q-Network (DQN) [(Mnih 2014)](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a deep neural network to learn a Q-function, which is a function that estimates the expected return for taking a given action in a given state. The goal of the DQN algorithm is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return by learning the Q-function and selecting the action with the highest estimated return in each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DQN algorithm consists of two main components: a Q-network and an experience buffer. The Q-network is a deep neural network that takes in a state as input and outputs the estimated Q-values for each possible action. The experience buffer is a data structure that stores a set of experiences. The DQN algorithm works by interacting with the environment and storing the experiences in the experience buffer. The Q-network is then trained using a mini-batch of experiences uniformly sampled from the experience buffer. This process is known as experience replay and is used to decorrelate the experiences and to stabilize the learning process. The Q-network is updated using the loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{i=1}^{B} \\bigl( \\mathrm{TD}~(s_i, a_i, s^{'}_{i}) \\bigr)^{2}\n",

    "\\mathrm{TD}~(s_i, a_i, s^{'}_{i}) = Q_{\\theta}~(s_i,a_i) - \\bigl(r_{(s_i,a_i,s_{i}^{'})} + \\gamma ~ \\underset{a^{'}_{i} \\sim \\bar{Q}_{\\theta}}{\\mathrm{max}} ~ \\bar{Q}_{\\theta}~(s_{i}^{'},a_{i}^{'}) \\bigr)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $Q_{\\theta}$ and $\\bar{Q}_{\\theta}$ denote learned and target Q-networks respectively. The target network is a copy of the Q-network that is updated less frequently, and using it to compute the target Q-values helps to stabilize the learning process and improve the performance of the DQN algorithm. Note that to increase stability of training we use Huber loss (smooth_l1_loss) instead of L2.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to incorporate exploration into the DQN algorithm. One common method is to use an $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy, where the agent takes a random action with probability $\\epsilon$ and takes the action with the highest estimated Q-value with probability $1 - \\epsilon$. The value of $\\epsilon$ is typically decreased over time, so that the agent initially explores more and then gradually shifts towards exploitation as it learns more about the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we implement all the components of a basic DQN. We start with the experience buffer - a data structure that stores a set of transitions, where a transition is typically represented as a tuple $(s, a, r, s', t)$, where $s$ is the state, $a$ is the action taken in state $s$, $r$ is the reward received by performing $a$ in $s$ and getting to $s'$, $s'$ is the new state observed after performing $a$ in $s$ and $t$ is the termination boolean (true if $s'$ is terminal). Experience buffers are used to store the experiences of an agent as it interacts with an environment, and are used to train a Q-function, which is a function that estimates the expected return for taking a given action in a given state. We implement **ExperienceBuffer** class using NumPy arrays and we define two methods:\n",

    "1. *add* - adds transition to the buffer\n",
    "2. *sample* - samples a batch of transitions from the buffer"

In contrast to that, $\\mathrm{TD}_{n}$ accumulated rewards over $n$ steps and sums it with the highest Q-value of the state that occured after $n$ steps [(Sutton 1988)](http://incompleteideas.net/papers/sutton-88-with-erratum.pdf). Double DQN $\\mathrm{TD}_{n}$ loss is defined by:\n",

As compared to single step reward and $s_{i}^{'}$ stored by the simple ExperienceBuffer, the main storage of this upgraded buffer should store $n$ step rewards and $s_{i+n}^{'}$."

This is exactly the idea behind the Dueling Q-network architecture [(Wang et al. 2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581.pdf). Decoupling Q-values into values and advantages offers some optimization benefits:\n",

    "1. $V^\\pi (s)$ is independent of actions, as such the value network will have less parameters than a Q-network\n",

    "Intuitively, the dueling Q-network can more efficiently learn which states are valuable, even when the actions available in those states do not affect the environment in a meaningful way. This can be particularly helpful in large or complex environments where it may not be possible to learn good action values for every state-action pair. Dueling DQN architecture uses joint feature layer and two separate heads to represent advantage and value streams (look at Figure 1. in [(Wang et al. 2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581.pdf)).

    "## 5. Prioritized experience replay\n",
    "\n",
    "In regular experience replay the transitions are uniformly sampled during training and used to update the agent's learning policy. Prioritized replay [(Schaul et al. 2015)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05952.pdf) is a variant of the experience replay buffer that prioritizes transitions based on the magnitude of the TD error, which is a measure of how much the agent's estimates of the action values deviate from the actual values. Transitions with a higher TD error are more important for learning, because they represent a greater deviation from the agent's current understanding of the environment. By prioritizing transitions with a higher TD error, the agent can more effectively learn from its experiences and improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement a prioritized replay buffer, we need to store not only the transitions themselves, but also the TD error for each transition. We will use a queue-like mechanism to prioritize the transitions based on their TD error, and sample transitions from the buffer using a priority-based sampling distribution. New transitions arrive with maximal priority in order to guarantee that all experience is seen at least once. This allows the agent to more effectively learn from rare or unusual transitions that might be overlooked in a standard experience replay buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to prioritize transitions in the experience replay buffer based on the TD error: greedy prioritization and stochastic prioritization. When using greedy prioritization, the transitions with the highest TD errors are replayed more frequently, which can lead to overfitting and overlooking certain transitions. To address this issue, we will use a stochastic prioritization method that balances between greedy prioritization and uniform random sampling introducing more diversity in the sampled transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(i) = \\frac{p_i^{\\alpha} + \\epsilon}{\\sum_{j=1}^{D} (p_j^{\\alpha} + \\epsilon)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p_i > 0$ denotes the priority of transition $i$ with $i, j \\in D$, $D$ denotes the buffer data, $\\epsilon$ is a small positive constant and the exponent $\\alpha$ determines how much prioritization is used, with $\\alpha = 0$ corresponding to the uniform sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimation of the expected value with stochastic updates relies on those updates corresponding to the same distribution as its expectation. Prioritized replay introduces bias because it changes this distribution in an uncontrolled fashion, and therefore changes the solution that the estimates will converge to (even if the policy and state distribution are fixed). To compensate for non-uniform sampling scheme, prioritized experience replay leverages one more mechanism - importance sampling. To this end, when calculating loss over the batch transition TD error is weighted with an importance weight:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{L}_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{B} \\sum_{i=1}^{B} \\bigl( w_i * \\mathrm{TD}~(s_i, a_i, s^{'}_{i}) \\bigr)^{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_i = \\big( \\frac{1}{D} \\cdot \\frac{1}{P(i)} \\big)^\\beta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which given $\\beta = 1$ fully compensates for the non uniform sampling. We will anneal values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ towards 1 throughout the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing priorities is often implemented via a Segment Tree. It allows us to be very efficient in sampling transitions, while creating a bit of overhead in writing new values. **You are not required to use segment tree, and no points will be subtracted for not using it. However we encourage to do it for better efficiency and shorter training time.** We provide you with the OpenAI implementation of a SegmentTree below. We recommend that you read a bit about segment trees before moving forward:\n",
